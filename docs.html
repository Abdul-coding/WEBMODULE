    <p>Hey guys, <br>

        In the next lesson, I'll be walking you through all the wonders of HTML anchor tags which will allow you to create links in your website. <br>
        
        In February 2018, the powers that be decided to disallow "cross-origin" file downloads. This means that if you are adding the download attribute to make a link into a direct download then it will no longer work unless you own the resource. <br>
        Later in the course, when we cover server side code, we'll be able to create links that point to same origin resources and you can come back to try and make the anchor tags downloadable. <br>
        
        For now, don't worry too much if this doesn't work for you. <br>

        All the best, <br>
        
        Tutor</p>
